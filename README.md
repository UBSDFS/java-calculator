Project Description
This project is a console-based Java Calculator Application designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, exception handling, and modular software design. It performs standard arithmetic operations and features a memory management system capable of storing, recalling, and performing operations on collections of integers. Developed in VS Code with GitHub for version control, this project emphasizes clean architecture, error handling, and maintainable code organization.
Project Tasks
• Task 1: Set up the development environment
  - Installed JDK and configured VS Code as the IDE
  - Initialized a GitHub repository for version control

• Task 2: Plan the project
  - Defined the project scope: build a modular calculator with exception handling
  - Designed class structure for separation of concerns

• Task 3: Implement core features
  - Developed arithmetic logic in CalculatorEngine
  - Built menu navigation and input handling in MenuControl
  - Added memory management via MemControl and MemoryStore

• Task 4: Test the application
  - Performed manual input validation and division-by-zero testing
  - Verified exception handling and boundary conditions for memory list

• Task 5: Document the project
  - Created a comprehensive README (this file)
  - Documented each class with purpose and usage comments

• Task 6: Finalize and submit
  - Uploaded final version to GitHub
  - Reviewed for code clarity, consistency, and usability
Project Skills Learned
• Java Programming Fundamentals (classes, objects, encapsulation, exception handling)
• Git and GitHub for version control and project tracking
• Modular Design and separation of logic (UI, computation, memory handling)
• Error Management through custom exception control
• Documentation & Presentation for professional project display
Language Used
• Java — Chosen for its strong OOP structure, clarity, and cross-platform compatibility.
Development Environment
• IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
• Version Control: Git & GitHub
• Java SDK: OpenJDK 17
• Operating System: Windows 10 / macOS compatible
• Dependencies: None (Standard Java Libraries only)
Development Process Used
• Agile-inspired workflow: Iterative development with incremental improvements and testing after each major feature.
• Version Control Discipline: Regular commits, feature branching, and documentation updates after testing.
